# Window spec for ordering by age within department

from pyspark.sql.functions import *  

windowspec = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy(desc("age"))

#Add both avg salary and row_number in one go  

final_df = df.withColumn("avg_salary", avg("salary").over(Window.partitionBy("department"))) \  
             .withColumn("row_num", row_number().over(windowspec))  
final_df.show()  

# Walking thru the each code

1. Create DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=columns)
df.show()



ðŸ‘‰ Basic employee dataset with name, age, department, salary.

2. Define Window for Ordering by Age
windowspec = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy(desc("age"))


partitionBy("department") â†’ groups employees within the same department.

orderBy(desc("age")) â†’ sorts employees by age descending inside each department.

Example:

Finance group â†’ [Pradeep(28), Suresh(22), Ram(20)]

Sales group â†’ [Sudeep(25), Iqbal(22)]

3. Add Average Salary Column
df.withColumn("avg_salary", avg("salary").over(Window.partitionBy("department")))


avg("salary") â†’ computes average salary.

.over(Window.partitionBy("department")) â†’ computes that average per department.

For Finance â†’ (50000 + 50000 + 20000) / 3 = 40000
For Sales â†’ (30000 + 20000) / 2 = 25000

So every employee gets their departmentâ€™s average salary as a new column.

4. Add Row Number Column
.withColumn("row_num", row_number().over(windowspec))


row_number() â†’ assigns a unique number starting from 1.

.over(windowspec) â†’ applies inside each department, ordered by age desc.

So:

Finance â†’ Pradeep(28) â†’ 1, Suresh(22) â†’ 2, Ram(20) â†’ 3

Sales â†’ Sudeep(25) â†’ 1, Iqbal(22) â†’ 2

5. Final Result
final_df.show()


ðŸ”¹ In Plain English

Group employees by department.

For each department:

Compute average salary and add it as a column.

Assign a row number based on descending age.
